# EclypseZ7_DIAL_System

This repository inlcude all the codes used in the development of the Master Thesis:
"Development of a Differential Absorption Lidar System based on a SoC-FPGA for Carbon Dioxide Sensing" by Victor Ricardo Aguilera Sanchez

The codes are located in Vivado, Vitis and Matlab folders. 
However, the design of the HW platform in VIvado is carefully explained in the Master Thesis.

In particular the codes and constraints used for the measurements obtained in the project are:
* Vivado_sources/Eclypse_Z7_Master
* Vitis_Codes/DIAL_ON_CHIP_CORR_ON_CHIP_CONFIG
* Matlab_Codes/ECLYPSE_Z7_DIAL_v3
