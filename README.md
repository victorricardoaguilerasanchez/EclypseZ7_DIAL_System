# EclypseZ7_DIAL_System

This repository include all the codes and constraints used in the development of the Master Thesis:
"Development of a Differential Absorption Lidar System based on a SoC-FPGA for Carbon Dioxide Sensing" by Victor Ricardo Aguilera Sanchez

The codes are located in Vivado, Vitis, and Matlab folders. 
However, the design of the HW platform in Vivado is carefully explained along the Master Thesis.

In particular, the codes and constraints used for the measurements obtained in the project are as follows:
* Vivado_Sources/Eclypse_Z7_Master
* Vitis_Codes/DIAL_ON_CHIP_CORR_ON_CHIP_CONFIG
* Matlab_Codes/ECLYPSE_Z7_DIAL_v3
